# Sample Cloudflare Tunnel configuration for the AI Affiliate project.
# Copy this file to one of the supported locations (prefer project root or %USERPROFILE%/.cloudflared/config.yml)
# and adjust the credentials-file path + tunnel UUID accordingly.

# Name of the existing tunnel (created with `cloudflared tunnel create core-backend`).
tunnel: core-backend

# Path to the credentials JSON produced during tunnel creation.
# On Windows this often lives under: C:\Users\<USER>\.cloudflared\<UUID>.json
credentials-file: C:\\Users\\<USER>\\.cloudflared\\<UUID>.json
